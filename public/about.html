  Hey! BELIEVE ME - it is an accident that you landed on this page. It is rare for someone to stumble here.
  But here you are.. I guess, welcome stranger!

  Cosine is the name and imagination is the game. WELL... cut that crap out. Seriously, I just do random stuffs
  that could preoccupy my convuluted mind and trying to come up with an output that would eventually be useless.

  Anyhow, I am a Computer Engineer by degree and job wise, have been exposed to research and development for the past 23 years.
  From embedded softwares used in cars ,to application softwares for printer products, to embdded controls for printer functions,
  and as well as involving myself to test teams , ensuring good quality before the printer functions exits to production and 
  checking issues encountered by customers. 23 years is still that young my friend.. Too many things to do.

  Outside work, I do run... if fast walk is considered part of running, then I'm a runner. I love to tinker stuffs - with my education 
  background- I love designing and building robots (for a hobby and to show off basically). Other than that, I tried run-bike-run competition
  just to prove a point that age is not a hindrance but making point that it can be done with proper pain medication meds (prior and after competition).

  I also love taking photos and love the grains of film.

  That is me in a nut shell.
